           In a heart-warming gesture, Afghanistan's opening batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz was spotted helping the needy people on the side of the street in Ahmedabad at 3 am. The video 
           of Gurbaz went viral on social media with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) -- the team he plays for in the Indian Premier League -- also sharing the clip. The Afghanistan star could 
           be seen giving money to the needy people, who were sleeping on the side of the street. "From working tirelessly to raise money for the victims of the Herat Earthquake in Afghanistan 
           earlier this month, to this act of kindness in a foreign land - you inspire us all. God bless you, jaani," wrote KKR while sharing the video.</p>

                Teams, Matches, Venues And More</h1>
            <img src="./sportspic/semi.webp" alt="" srcset="">
            <p>   The two semi-finals of Cricket World Cup 2023 will be held on November 15 and 16 in Mumbai and Kolkata respectively.
                Semi-final 1: India will take on New Zealand in the first fixture of the knockouts at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. 
                The two teams had famously squared-off in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup too where the match spanned over two days due to rain. 
                India were beaten by the Kiwis in the match. Rohit Sharma's men will be keen to not let the history repeat itself this time.  
                India vs New Zealand, semi-final 1: November 15, Wednesday, 2:00 PM IST at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.  
                Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com
                Semi-final 2:Australia and South Africa will square off in the second semi-final of the World Cup 2023. Australia, 5-time champions, lost their opening two league stage matches before winning seven on the bounce to seal the third spot in the points table. South Africa, on the other hand, also won 7 of their 9 league matches, including a victory over the Kangaroos. 
                The Proteas might have a morale advantage, having already beaten Pat Cummins' men but history favours the latter.
                It would be interesting to see if South Africa can overcome the Australian challenge once again to book their spot in an ODI World Cup final for the first time ever.
                Australia vs South Africa, semi-final 2:November 16, Thursday, 2:00 PM IST at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata</p>
